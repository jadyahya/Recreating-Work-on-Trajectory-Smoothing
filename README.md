# Recreating-Work-on-Trajectory-Smoothing
This work is recreated from the paper: A Convex Optimization Approach to Smooth Trajectories for Motion Planning with Car-Like Robots
By Zhijie Zhu, Edward Schmerling, and Marco Pavone

To run these you should have YALMIP installed. Please check the following website to install YALMIP:
